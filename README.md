## <a name="features"></a>Features

  * List members of a class, including (static) fields, (static) methods and ctors.
  * List classes or subpackages of a package.
  * Provide parameters information of a method, list all overload methods.
  * Complete an incomplete word.
  * Provide a complete JAVA parser written in Vim script language.
  * Use the JVM to obtain most information.
  * Use the embedded parser to obtain the class information from source files.
  * Tags generated by ctags can also be used.
  * JSP is supported, Builtin objects such as request, session can be recognized.
  * The classes and jar files in the WEB-INF will be appended automatically to classpath.


## <a name="requirements"></a>Requirements

It works on all the platforms where
  * Vim version 7.0 and above
  * JDK version 1.1 and above
existed 


## <a name="what-it-offers"></a>What it offers

It recognize nearly all kinds of Primary Expressions (see langspec-3.0)
except for "Primary.new Indentifier". Casting conversion is also supported.
Samples of input contexts are as following:	(<kbd>|</kbd> indicates cursor)


### after '.', list members of a class or a package

  * package.|         subpackages and classes of a package
  * Type.|                static members of the 'Type' class and "class"
  * var.| or field.|     members of a variable or a field
  * method().|         members of result of method()
  * this.|                   members of the current class
  * ClassName.this.|  members of the qualified class
  * super.|               members of the super class
  * array.|                members of an array object
  * array[i].|             array access, return members of the element of array
  * "String".|            String literal, return members of java.lang.String
  * int.| or void.|       primitive type or pseudo-type, return "class"
  * int[].|                   array type, return members of a array type and "class"
  * java.lang.String[].|
  * new int[].|           members of the new array instance
  * new java.lang.String[i=1][].|
  * new Type().|      members of the new class instance 
  * Type.class.|      class literal, return members of java.lang.Class
  * void.class.| or int.class.|
  * ((Type)var).|         cast var as Type, return members of Type.
  * (var.method()).|   same with "var.|"
  * (new Class()).|    same with "new Class().|"


### after '(', list matching methods with parameters information.

  * method(|)                 methods matched
  * var.method(|)           methods matched
  * new ClassName(|)  constructors matched
  * this(|)                        constructors of current class matched
  * super(|)                     constructors of super class matched

Any place between '(' and ')' will be supported soon.  
Help information of javadoc is not supported yet.


### after an incomplete word, list all the matched beginning with it.

  * var.ab|          subset of members of var beginning with `ab`
  * ab|                list of all maybes


### import statement

  * " import         java.util.|"
  * " import         java.ut|"
  * " import         ja|"
  * " import         java.lang.Character.|"        e.g. "Subset"
  * " import static java.lang.Math.|"        e.g. "PI, abs"


### package declaration

   * " package         com.|"

The above are in simple expression.


### after compound expression:

  * PrimaryExpr.var.|
  * PrimaryExpr.method().|
  * PrimaryExpr.method(|)
  * PrimaryExpr.var.ab|
   e.g.
  * "java.lang        . System.in .|"
  * "java.lang.System.getenv().|"
  * "int.class.toString().|"
  * "list.toArray().|"
  * "new ZipFile(path).|"
  * "new ZipFile(path).entries().|"


### Nested expression:

  * "System.out.println( str.| )"
  * "System.out.println(str.charAt(| )"
  * "for (int i = 0; i < str.|; i++)"
  * "for ( Object o : a.getCollect| )"


## <a name="how-to-contribute"></a>How to contribute

Open a pull request.

At the moment, this is pretty the original project.  
The only changes I made are:
  * Changed the `s:Log` function to write in a file under `/tmp/` in this way I can debug what happens (the plugin is pretty complex to follow)
  * Added a huge amount of logs
  * Disabled the collection of data from `tags` because it is really bugged: in a sense that it collects data from tags and then it expects a format that is absolutely not matching with the content returned by that function
  * Added [vim-vspec](https://github.com/kana/vim-vspec) in order to add tests so that changing it would not break everything


## <a name="limits"></a>Limitations

The embedded parser works a bit slower than expected.


## <a name="todos"></a>TODOs

  - Improve performance of the embedded parser. Incremental parser.
  - Add quick information using balloonexpr, ballooneval, balloondelay.
  - Add javadoc
  - Give a hint for class name conflict in different packages.
  - Support parameter information for template
  - Make it faster and more robust.
